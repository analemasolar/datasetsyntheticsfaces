# Description of the Synthetic Image Dataset

## Technical Characteristics:

1. **Resolution**: Images have a resolution of 256x256 pixels.
2. **File Format**: Images are in PNG format.
3. **Data Type**: Images are in color (RGB format).
4. **Total Amount of Images**: The dataset consists of 2000 synthetic images.
5. **Gender represented**: The dataset has the gender: male and female.
6. **Distribution by Gender**: Each of the two genders includes 100 representative images.
7. **Distribution by Age Segment**: The dataset covers a wide spectrum of age ranges, with a unique image for each age segment. These segments include:

- 0-2 years
- 3-6 years
- 7-9 years
- 10-14 years
- 15-19 years
- 20-29 years
- 30-39 years
- 40-49 years
- 50-69 years
- 70-120 years

## Generation of Synthetic Images through Latent Space

The original images were subjected to synthetic transformations through latent space manipulations of a generative model. Each initial image was transformed into 10 male and 10 female variants, covering different age ranges.

## Ethical and Privacy Considerations

Each image in the dataset has been created and manipulated through latent space, ensuring that they are synthetic images. This ensures that privacy rights are observed, and relevant ethical principles are considered in the processing and use of data.
